# C4-vii remaining work — bootstrap for the next session

**Read `CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and the `C4-vii` block in `TASKS.md` first.** This doc is the
self-contained handoff for the two *unfinished* C4-vii sub-bugs. Both turned out to be **structural
right-of-way (RoW) core ports**, each roughly a full rung with high regression risk — not gate fixes.

## What is already DONE (on `main`, do not redo)

| Piece | Commit | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| C4-vii-b | `4d7e2d9` | Keep-right over-accumulation + final-edge arrival strand (vehicles no longer freeze at lane ends). Parity-reviewer ACCEPTED. Anchor `scenarios/45-multilane-keepright-arrival`. |
| Crash fix | `eac0a5b` | C4-vii-b's keep-right crashed on any multi-lane junction (`ComputeBestLanes` on an internal edge). Guarded: no keep-right on internal lanes. |
| Diagnostics | this doc's commit | `scenarios/_diag/c4vii-willpass-grid/` (the reproduction) + `C4viiWillpassGridDiagTests` (crash regression + C4-vii-c stuck-count guard). |

**Invariants for anything you commit** (CLAUDE.md rule 3): committed suite stays green
(currently **162 passed + 1 skipped**), `Sim.Bench` determinism hash **unchanged**
(`7291978050025285112`), a non-vacuous anchor, and a **parity-reviewer ACCEPT** before promoting to
`main`. Build the anchor + golden FIRST, then instrument + fix.

## Golden regeneration essentials (network side, ends in a commit)

SUMO 1.20.0 is at `/usr/local/bin/sumo`; vendored source at `sumo/`. Per-scenario golden command
(the committed anchors all use this):

```
sumo -c config.sumocfg --fcd-output golden.fcd.xml --fcd-output.acceleration --precision 6 \
     --save-state.times 1 --save-state.files golden.state.xml --no-step-log true
python3 scripts/dump-scenario-vtypes.py config.sumocfg golden.vtype.json
```

**Determinism flags every committed scenario/config MUST set** (a missing one silently diverges —
this bit me twice this session): in `<processing>`:
`<step-method.ballistic value="false"/>`, `<default.action-step-length value="1"/>`,
`<default.speeddev value="0"/>`, `<time-to-teleport value="-1"/>`; plus `<step-length value="1"/>`
and a `<random_number><seed value="42"/></random_number>`. `sigma="0"` on the vType.

`tolerance.json`: `{"parityMode":"exact","comparedAttributes":["lane","pos","speed"],"pos":0.001,"speed":0.001}`.
`provenance.txt`: mirror an existing scenario's (sha256 of every input+golden, sumo_version=1.20.0).

## C4-vii-c — DONE, but the root cause was NOT willPass (route→lane over-constraint)

**RESOLVED (this session), with a corrected diagnosis. Read this before trusting the willPass framing below.**
Instrumenting the committed grid showed the gridlock is a **route→lane / boundary-convergence bug**,
not the willPass signal:

- **29 of the 38 stuck vehicles were clamped by the C2-ii convergence guard** (`Engine.cs` ExecuteMoves,
  `v.LaneHandle != _laneSeqPool[slot]`): stranded at a lane end at speed 0 because their actual lane ≠
  the pool's *resolved exit lane*, **even though that lane connects onward**. The pool over-constrains:
  208 of the grid's 224 two-lane edges have BOTH lanes connecting to a common downstream edge (a
  straight move leaves from either), yet the pool pins one exit lane (chasing a downstream
  `bestLaneOffset` hint), so a vehicle on the other equally-valid connecting lane was frozen forever.
- The other 9 stuck all transitively yielded to those clamp victims. **The willPass gate had zero
  independent effect** — verified: gate on/off gave identical stuck counts on the grid, and a ~20-config
  dense-`-L2` sweep never showed willPass reducing stuck. The original instrumentation that saw foes
  "moving then braking to a stop this step" was watching a *moving vehicle hit the convergence clamp at a
  lane end* (an execute-time hard stop), not a plan-time willPass yield.

**FIX (committed):** `Engine.TryReResolveFromActualLane` + `NetworkModel.ResolveSequenceCore`'s
`forceFirstExitToArrival`. When a vehicle reaches a lane end on a non-pool lane that still connects to
the next route edge, re-resolve the remaining route from that lane (pinning the edge exit to it) and
proceed — SUMO's "follow whatever connection leaves the current lane, lane-change toward bestLaneOffset
opportunistically" (`MSVehicle::updateBestLanes`). Only ever reached from the boundary branch that used
to clamp, so every committed golden is byte-identical; the diag grid drops from ~38 stuck to **0** (==
SUMO), suite **162 + 1 skip** green, `Sim.Bench` hash unchanged (`909605E965BFFE59`). **ANCHOR:**
`scenarios/46-convergence-lane` (`RungC4viiConvergenceLaneParityTests`) — a single vehicle that
keep-rights onto a connecting non-pool lane; pre-fix strands it at the lane end, post-fix flows it
(pos/speed exact vs SUMO; lane excluded — keep-right timing is a separate C4-vii-b gap).

**The willPass port was IMPLEMENTED then REVERTED** (faithful to `MSLink::blockedByFoe`, but provably
inert on the suite + grid, un-anchorable, and its pre-pass doubled plan-phase work). Revive it only when
a genuine willPass scenario is isolated.

**Follow-up exposed by this fix — NOW FIXED + regression-tested.** The convergence fix rescues vehicles
that used to clamp at a lane end (never entering the junction); they now proceed onto junction interiors,
which made a latent crash reachable: a vehicle transiting a MULTI-LANE junction's internal lane while its
pool wants the sibling internal lane reached `DecideSpeedGainChanges`' strategic-LC path →
`ComputeBestLanes(route, ':A0_2')` → throws (an internal edge is never on an edge-only route). FIX: skip
ALL lane-change decisions (keep-right/strategic/speed-gain) on internal lanes — SUMO's `MSLaneChanger`
runs only on normal edges (mirrors commit `eac0a5b`'s keep-right guard, hoisted to also cover the
strategic path). This is the FAITHFUL fix, not a band-aid. REGRESSION ANCHOR:
`scenarios/_diag/multilane-internal-lc-crash` (`MultilaneInternalLcCrashDiagTests`) — a 3x3 -L2 grid,
10 trips; without the guard the engine throws `Edge ':A0_2' is not part of the given route`, with it the
grid runs to completion and flows (0 stuck == SUMO). Verified across a ~10-config dense-`-L2` sweep
(6×6/8×8 priority + TLS, up to 800 veh): all now run without crashing.

**No residual gridlock (checked, NOT a bug).** On dense TLS grids the engine has MORE vehicles still
queued at an arbitrary mid-run cutoff than SUMO (tls.guess 6×6/150 veh: 36 vs 19 at t=400; 375-veh TLS
grid: 137 vs 66 at t=400) — but this is purely transient: run long enough and BOTH fully drain (150-veh
grid: 0 stuck / all arrived by t=800; 375-veh grid: 0 / all arrived by t=1000). All the mid-run queuing
is on NORMAL lanes (0 mid-junction), i.e. red-light waiting / junction-approach throughput, not the
crash and not a keepClear box-block. The engine simply drains slower than SUMO on dense TLS density —
an exact-throughput/-timing gap that belongs to the broad -L2 TLS FCD-parity frontier (its own rung),
NOT a gridlock defect. Priority grids need no extra time (engine ≤ SUMO queued throughout).

---

## (superseded) C4-vii-c — willPass PRE-PASS (original bootstrap framing; kept for history)

### Symptom & reproduction (committed, deterministic)
`scenarios/_diag/c4vii-willpass-grid/` (6×6 -L2 priority grid, 75 trips). **SUMO: 0 of 75 stuck.
Engine: ~40 stuck.** `C4viiWillpassGridDiagTests` runs it and guards `stuck <= 45`. (The TLS variant
`gc.sumocfg` in the old scratch behaved the same; priority is the cleaner repro — no signal timing.)
Regen recipe if you want a fresh/smaller one:
`netgenerate --grid --grid.number=6 --grid.length=250 -L 2 --seed 7` (priority; add `--tls.guess`
for TLS) + `randomTrips.py -n net -e 300 -p 4 --fringe-factor 10 --min-distance 500 --seed 7`
+ `duarouter --named-routes --ignore-errors`.

### Root cause (instrumented this session — do not re-derive)
Ego yields forever to a foe that is itself yielding. SUMO's `MSLink::blockedByFoe` returns false for
`!avi.willPass` (`sumo/src/microsim/MSLink.cpp:935`); `willPass` = `setRequest =
(vNext > NUMERICAL_EPS_SPEED && !abortRequestAfterMinor) || leavingCurrentIntersection`
(`sumo/src/microsim/MSVehicle.cpp:2732`). **The load-bearing term is `vNext` — the foe's PLANNED
speed THIS step, not its start-of-step speed.**

Instrumenting the priority grid (add a temporary `public static Dictionary<...> DebugCross` in
`Engine.cs`, record `(foeId, foe.Speed, SeenToInternalLaneEntry(foe,...), egoPos)` whenever the
crossing arm applies a finite constraint, then dump it for stuck vehicles) showed:
- A **stopped-foe proxy** (`foe.startOfStepSpeed <= NumericalEps` ⇒ willPass=false) is faithful and
  helps (**40→32**, tls 48→37) but is **insufficient**. Not committed.
- The **residual root vehicles are only ~5–8** (the other ~24 stuck are just **queued behind them**
  by car-following — fix the roots and the queues drain). Those roots yield to foes that are **close
  (seen 1–5 m) and MOVING (3–13 m/s)** — but those foes are **braking to a stop this step** (they are
  themselves yielding), so their `vNext ≈ 0` and SUMO's willPass is FALSE. The engine's frozen-
  snapshot model reads *start-of-step* speed (> 0) and yields → gridlock.

### The fix (structural): a willPass PRE-PASS
Add a phase, from the frozen start-of-step snapshot, that computes for each vehicle whether it
**intends to enter its upcoming junction link this step** (its `vNext`-at-the-link > ~0). Then the
crossing approaching-foe arm of `JunctionYieldConstraint` (`Engine.cs`, the
`foeInternalSeqIndex > foe.LaneSeqIndex` branch, ~line 1737 — where `foeStoppedAtStopLine` was
prototyped) blocks ego **only** on a foe whose willPass is true.

- Break the circularity the way SUMO does (`setApproaching` runs before `opened()`): the pre-pass
  computes each vehicle's intended entry **without** the foe-willPass refinement — one level of
  approximation. Practically, `willPass(foe) ≈ foe's planned CF/cautious-approach speed at its own
  stop line > NUMERICAL_EPS_SPEED`. The engine already computes each vehicle's `vNext` in
  `PlanMovements`; the pre-pass is essentially "plan speeds ignoring foe-willPass, cache them, then
  do the yield decisions reading the cache."
- The **visibility case** folds in for free: a moving foe beyond its own minor link's 4.5 m
  foe-visibility (`abortRequestAfterMinor`, `MSVehicle.cpp:2730`) has its `vNext` limited by the
  cautious approach, so its willPass comes out false without a separate branch.
- ECS/zero-alloc (DESIGN.md): the willPass result is one bool per vehicle — store it on
  `VehicleRuntime` (like `KeepRightProbability`), written once per step in the pre-pass, read in the
  yield pass. No per-step allocation.

### Done-condition
Grid `stuck` drops to ~0 (tighten `C4viiWillpassGridDiagTests`); a NEW minimal FIXED-ROUTE
deterministic anchor (a small 2×2/3×3 -L2 grid or a hand-built 3–4-vehicle cycle) where SUMO flows
and the pre-fix engine gridlocks, gauged by stuck-count (a gridlocked state is not a per-step FCD
golden, so this anchor asserts stuck-count/arrival, not exact FCD); committed suite stays green;
`Sim.Bench` hash unchanged; parity-reviewer ACCEPT.

### Traps
- A single-crossroads **continuous 4-left-turn stream does NOT reproduce** it (engine+SUMO both flow,
  0 stuck) and a **dense mixed stream over-saturates** (SUMO also queues). You need multi-junction
  density or a hand-built cycle.
- Do **not** use start-of-step speed as willPass — it misses braking foes (that's why the proxy only
  got 40→32).

## C4-vii-a part 2 — internal-junction RoW (cont turns)

### Status
**Part 1 (the cont-lane internal via-chain SEQUENCE fix) is DONE and committed** (the lost
`claude/handoff-docs-i5a9vm` / `1cb6c12` was unrecoverable, so it was re-derived):
`NetworkModel.ResolveSequenceCore` now follows the full via-chain (`:C_3_0` then `:C_16_0`), the engine
occupies `:C_16_0`, inert on the whole suite + Sim.Bench. Anchor `scenarios/_diag/cont-turn-sequence`
(`ContTurnSequenceDiagTests`). **Parts 2a-2c (the cont-turn SPEED) are open:** (2a) resolve the cautious-
approach `approachLane` back over the intermediate `:C_3_0` to the normal lane (prototyped this session,
fires the approach slowdown but insufficient alone); (2b) turn-speed cap for the 9.26 m/s internal
lanes; (2c) model the internal junction `:C_16` as a first-class minor link (its own cautious approach +
`<request>` foes). SUMO enters `:C_3_0` at 3.55 m/s; the engine still enters at ~11. Full scenario 44
additionally needs bug B (spurious final-edge LC under conflict) and the symmetric-4-way arrival-time
RoW (bug C -- a distinct port, NOT willPass). This is a large multi-subsystem rung; each piece needs its
own anchor + gate.

### Root cause (this session)
For a `cont` link (a turn split by an INTERNAL JUNCTION into two internal lanes, e.g. `NC→CE` =
`:C_3_0` then `:C_16_0`), SUMO's minor-link cautious slowdown happens at the **internal junction
`:C_16`'s conflict zone, NOT the junction entry**: the vehicle enters `:C_3_0` at full speed and
brakes hard on `:C_3_0` (golden: `13.89 → 10.04 → 5.54 → 8.14 → 9.26`) for `:C_16`'s foes. Two coupled
problems, both verified byte-identical on the suite but insufficient alone:
- **2a (lane resolution).** `JunctionYieldConstraint`'s `egoInternalLaneId` scan (`Engine.cs:~1498`)
  finds the link's internal lane `:C_16_0` (junction C's `IntLanes[3]`), so `approachLane =
  pool[idx-1]` resolves to the intermediate internal lane `:C_3_0`, not the normal lane `NC_1` → `seen`
  goes negative → the cautious arm never fires. Candidate fix: walk `approachLane` back over `:`-edge
  pool lanes to the last normal lane; set `egoOnInternal = LaneSeqIndex > approachSeqIndex`.
- **2b (speed gate).** The cautious arm gates the whole braking on `brakeDist < seen`; SUMO computes
  `stopSpeed` unconditionally and only gates the `laneStopOffset` clamp on
  `canBrakeBeforeLaneEnd = seen >= brakeDist` (`MSVehicle.cpp:2648`).
- **BUT** 2a+2b together still don't match: with `approachLane=NC_1` the engine brakes at the ENTRY
  (t=15: 12.99 vs golden 13.89), because SUMO doesn't brake at the entry at all — it brakes for the
  internal junction. **The real fix is to model each cont link's internal junction (`:C_16`, an
  `type="internal"` junction with its own `<request>`/foes) as a FIRST-CLASS minor link** with its
  own cautious approach + RoW. The 9b/C4 model assumes one internal lane + one conflict zone per link.

### Anchor
Lone `NC→CE` left turn on the `scenarios/44-multilane-junction-turn` crossroads net; config
ballistic=false + speeddev=0; SUMO golden `:C_3_0`@t17 → `:C_16_0`@t18 → `CE_1`@t19 with the dip
above. (Scratch was `scratchpad/c4vii-a/` — ephemeral; regenerate.) This is a big port for a *subset*
of junctions (multi-lane turns) — re-evaluate priority vs C4-vii-c, which unblocks -L2 flow generally.

## #3 Roundabout box-blocking on tight single-lane rings (diagnosed, NOT fixed — deep core port)

**Status: precise diagnosis, no fix landed.** A safe overnight fix does not exist — the fix is a full
`MSVehicle::checkRewindLinkLanes` port with cross-continuation space reservation, HIGH regression risk
to scenario `34-keepclear` and every junction parity scenario. The trigger geometry is *pathological*
(25 m-radius ring, ~35 m ring edges); the viz session's `city-mixed-1k` shows **normal** single-lane
roundabouts flow fine at 1000 concurrent (~2% stuck). Documented here so the next session can decide
priority without re-deriving.

### Reproduction (ephemeral, hand-built — recipe below)
A 4-arm single-lane roundabout: ring nodes `RN/RE/RS/RW` (`type="priority"`, ring edges `priority=10`,
entry/exit edges `priority=1`), radius 25 m, ring speed 8.33, arm speed 13.89. 251 fixed-route trips
(`randomTrips -e 600 --fringe-factor 10 --seed 7`, `duarouter --named-routes --remove-loops`), sigma=0,
Euler, teleport off, seed 42, 800 steps. Nodes/edges were `scratchpad/rb/{n.nod.xml,e.edg.xml}`;
regenerate with `netconvert -n n.nod.xml -e e.edg.xml`. **Result: SUMO 0 stuck / 251, engine 69 stuck.**

### Evidence (decisive)
- Stuck breakdown: 49 queued on ENTRY edges, 16 on RING edges, **4 stopped ON internal junction lanes**
  (`:RN_3_0`, `:RE_3_0` — the circulating left/continue-around movements).
- Stopped-on-internal-lane vehicle-steps: **SUMO = 0 (never), engine ≈ 500 per `_3` link.** SUMO never
  lets a vehicle halt on a junction; the engine does — this IS the box-block.
- Single-vehicle trace (veh 148, ends stuck on `:RN_3_0`): at t=324 it is on ring-approach `REtoRN`
  ~10 m from the junction at 6.3 m/s (brakeGap ≈ 4.4 m < 9.5 m stop distance — it *could* still stop);
  exit `RNtoRW` then shows nominal free space *behind its frontmost stopped vehicle*. It commits to
  `:RN_3` at t=325 and is trapped mid-junction as `RNtoRW` packs (4 veh, 2 stopped) the same step.

### Root cause
`KeepClearConstraint` (Engine.cs:~1940, the ported *removal* half of `checkRewindLinkLanes`) computes
the exit chain's free space via `LaneSpaceTillLastStanding`, which returns the room ahead of the
**frontmost stopped** vehicle and ignores the still-*moving* vehicles filling that room behind it. So a
circulating vehicle sees "≥ egoLen free" and enters, but the space is being consumed by leaders that
halt the same/next step → ego stops on the junction. SUMO's full `checkRewindLinkLanes` reserves the
exit space across the whole downstream continuation (approaching vehicles reduce `availableSpace`), so
circulating vehicles *wait on the ring approach edge*, keeping the junction clear and letting
perpendicular exits drain the ring. This is exactly the documented `KeepClearConstraint` SIMPLIFICATION
("lengthsInFront = 0, single-internal-lane back-propagation, no reservation") biting on a topology the
`34-keepclear` anchor never exercised (multi-junction ring, no slack).

### Fix sketch (for a future dedicated rung, gated + anchored)
Port the reservation half of `checkRewindLinkLanes`: accumulate `availableSpace` across the best-lanes
continuation subtracting **approaching** vehicles (those with a set link reservation on each exit lane),
not only stopped ones; hold ego at the junction-entry stop line when cumulative `leftSpace < 0`. Build a
committed tight-roundabout stuck-count anchor (`_diag`, gauged by stuck ≤ small, same convention as
`willpass-saturation`) and re-verify `34-keepclear` byte-identical. HIGH regression risk — its own rung.

## #2 Symmetric arrival-time RoW — the right-before-left conflict cycle (FIXED, deterministic)

**Status: FIXED and landed (`Engine.ResolveRightBeforeLeftCycles`), parity-reviewer ACCEPT.** This is
"bug C" from `TASKS.md` (the symmetric-4-way deadlock), isolated to its cleanest form and resolved with
a deterministic, order-independent port of SUMO's deadlock-break. The isolated anchor
`RungSymRblStraightDiagTests` is un-skipped and green (0 stuck). The whole committed suite stays
byte-identical and the Sim.Bench hash is unchanged — the post-pass is INERT wherever no directed
response cycle exists. **Residual (tracked to #3):** on a dense all-`right_before_left` grid the fix
strictly improves flow (baseline 195 stuck / 1794 cross-lane overlaps → 0 stuck / 112 overlaps) but does
not reach SUMO's exact behaviour (100 stuck / 0 overlaps); the residual crossing overlaps are the
pre-existing missing keepClear box-blocking (#3), not this change. Original diagnosis retained below.

### Isolated anchor (committed, skip-gated)
`scenarios/_diag/sym-rbl-straight/` — one single-lane `right_before_left` crossroads, four STRAIGHT
vehicles (`ns/sn/ew/we`), one per approach, all departing t=0 from rest 100 m out (perfectly
symmetric). `--precision 6` golden + `provenance.txt` + `RungSymRblStraightDiagTests` (`[Fact(Skip=…)]`
until this lands; suite stays green). Distinct from scenario 26 (asymmetric 2-veh right-before-left,
one clear winner, already green).

### Behaviour
- **SUMO**: flows all four. The N-S axis (`ns`+`sn`, parallel, non-conflicting) crosses first (t=17..20),
  then E-W (t=19..24). 0 stuck.
- **Engine**: DEADLOCKS. All four drive onto the junction (t=17..19) and stop **mid-junction**, each
  blocking the next around the ring; none exits. 4/4 permanently stuck.

### Root cause
The four straights form a directed right-before-left **4-cycle** (each yields to the movement on its
right): `NC→CS`(link 1) → `WC→CE`(13) → `SC→CN`(9) → `EC→CW`(5) → `NC→CS`(1). No movement has priority
over its own foe and all arrive together, so the C4-viii willPass pre-pass resolves `WillPass=false`
for **all four** (each is braking-to-yield). In the real pass the crossing gate's
`foeYieldsThisStep = !foe.WillPass` (Engine.cs:1899) is then TRUE for every ego — each thinks "my foe
won't pass, so I needn't yield" — and all four proceed simultaneously → mutual mid-junction gridlock.
(Before C4-viii this same case sat stuck at the *stop line* instead; the willPass gate converts a
stop-line standoff into a mid-junction one. It is out of willPass scope by construction — a foe
yielding to EGO and a foe yielding to a THIRD party both read `WillPass=false`, and the gate cannot
tell them apart without settled per-vehicle ordering.)

**How SUMO breaks it (verified in the vendored source — this CORRECTS an earlier "sequential ordering"
guess).** `MSVehicle::planMoveInternal` (MSVehicle.cpp:2818–2839) has an EXPLICIT right-before-left
deadlock detector. For a link in `LINKSTATE_EQUAL` (netconvert's `state="="` for the straight/left
movements at a `right_before_left` junction) with `myWaitingTime > 0` (ego already halted at the stop
line), SUMO walks the blocker chain `MSLink::getFirstApproachingFoe` (MSLink.cpp:1080 — the closest
`willPass` foe on each foeLink) up to 100 hops; if the chain WRAPS BACK to ego's own link
(`blocker.second == *link`) it is a circular-yield deadlock, and SUMO breaks it **randomly**:
`if (RandHelper::rand(getRNG()) < threshold) setRequest = false`, `threshold = 0.25` for a STRAIGHT
movement and `0.75` for a turn. A deadlocked vehicle rolls its RNG each step and, with per-step prob
0.25 (straight), aborts its request — yields — and the cycle unwinds (here N-S goes at t=17, E-W at t=19).

### Fix design (own rung — statistical only, gated)
This is a RANDOM tie-break keyed on the vehicle RNG. Per the engine's determinism policy (CLAUDE.md /
C1: "distribution SHAPE ported, RNG STREAM is ours" — VehicleRng/SplitMix64, never SUMO's RandHelper),
which vehicle backs off on which step will NOT match SUMO, so **exact @1e-3 FCD parity is NOT
achievable** — only STUCK-COUNT / statistical parity (deadlock breaks, all four drain to SUMO's 0
stuck, but the per-step trajectory differs). Port:
1. In `ComputeWillPass` (or the crossing gate), for a vehicle with `WaitingTime > 0` at a
   `LINKSTATE_EQUAL` link, detect a circular yield: follow the foe-it-yields-to (closest willPass foe on
   its response-matrix foeLinks), then that foe's yield target, up to N hops; if it wraps back to ego's
   link, it is a cycle.
2. Roll `VehicleRng` with `threshold` 0.25 (straight) / 0.75 (turn); on success force `WillPass = false`
   (abort the request) so ego yields and the cycle unwinds.
3. Faithful reference: `MSVehicle.cpp:2818–2839` (detector + abort) and `MSLink::getFirstApproachingFoe`
   (MSLink.cpp:1080). The engine already has the response matrix + `FindFoeVehicle`; the new piece is the
   bounded foe-chain walk and the seeded roll, computed order-independently from the frozen snapshot.

**Gate**: the detector is INERT wherever no `LINKSTATE_EQUAL` cycle exists (every committed single-foe
crossing scenario has a unique priority/arrival winner, no cycle), so the full committed suite should
stay byte-identical and `Sim.Bench` hash unchanged (`909605E965BFFE59`); `RungSymRblStraightDiagTests`
asserts `stuck==0` (stuck-count, NOT FCD parity); parity-reviewer ACCEPT. If it moves ANY committed
golden, revert.

## #4 Multi-lane cont-turn SPEED (C4-vii-a parts 2a–2c) — refined with exact SUMO mechanism + trajectory

**Status: mechanism pinned + trajectory captured, NOT fixed (large multi-part junction-speed port,
HIGH regression risk to every minor-link turn).** Part 1 (the internal via-chain SEQUENCE) is DONE on
`main`; this is the cont-turn SPEED that keeps scenario 44 skip-gated.

### Trajectory evidence (lone `NC→CE` left turn, `scenarios/_diag/cont-turn-sequence`)
SUMO (`--precision 6`) vs engine, the divergence window:

| t | SUMO lane / speed | engine lane / speed |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | `NC_1` 13.890 | `NC_1` 13.890 |
| 16 | `NC_1` **10.036** | `NC_1` 11.700 |
| 17 | `:C_3_0` **5.536** | `:C_16_0` 9.260 |
| 18 | `:C_16_0` 8.136 | `:C_16_0` 9.260 |
| 19 | `CE_1` 9.260 | `CE_1` 9.260 |

The turn is a MINOR link (connection `state="m"`) and both internal lanes (`:C_3` 5.01 m, `:C_16`
14.34 m) are speed-capped at 9.26. SUMO brakes to **10.04** approaching junction C, then dips to
**5.54** on `:C_3` (cautiously approaching the internal junction `:C_16`), then re-accelerates. The
engine does neither dip — it just clamps at the 9.26 internal-lane cap.

### Exact mechanism (verified, MSVehicle.cpp:2805–2812 — the `couldBrakeForMinor` cautious approach)
```
couldBrakeForMinor = !link.havePriority() && brakeDist < seen && !link.lastWasContMajor();
determinedFoePresence = seen <= link.getFoeVisibilityDistance();
if (couldBrakeForMinor && !determinedFoePresence) {           // too far to see foes yet -> slow so you CAN stop
    maxSpeedAtVisibilityDist = maximumSafeStopSpeed(visibilityDistance, maxDecel, speed, false, 0, false);
    maxArrivalSpeed = estimateSpeedAfterDistance(visibilityDistance, maxSpeedAtVisibilityDist, maxAccel);
    arrivalSpeed = MIN2(vLinkPass, maxArrivalSpeed);
    slowedDownForMinor = true;
}
```
`arrivalSpeed` (the capped speed AT the link) then feeds the car-follow `freeSpeed` toward the link,
producing the observed decel-then-accel. This DETERMINISTIC branch (no RNG) means #4 IS exact-parity
achievable — unlike #2 which is the RNG-keyed `else if` sibling at :2818. The lone turn needs it fired
at BOTH minor links: the entry `NC→:C_3` (the 10.04 dip) and the internal-junction `:C_3→:C_16`
(the 5.54 dip). The engine already applies a cautious minor-link approach for single-internal-lane
turns (scenarios 11/26/32/33 pass), so the missing pieces are exactly the doc's 2a–2c:

- **2a** — for a `cont` link, `JunctionYieldConstraint`'s `approachLane` resolves to the intermediate
  internal lane `:C_3_0`, not the normal lane `NC_1`, so `seen` is wrong (goes negative) and the
  cautious arm never fires. Walk `approachLane` back over `:`-edge pool lanes to the last normal lane.
- **2b** — gate the whole braking unconditionally (SUMO computes `stopSpeed`/`arrivalSpeed` always and
  only gates the `laneStopOffset` clamp on `canBrakeBeforeLaneEnd`), and add the `couldBrakeForMinor`
  `arrivalSpeed` cap above.
- **2c** — model the internal junction `:C_16` as a FIRST-CLASS minor link with its own
  `getFoeVisibilityDistance` + `<request>` foes, so the 5.54 dip fires there (a lone turn enters
  `:C_3_0` at 5.54 in SUMO but the engine enters at ~9.26).

**Why deferred.** This changes the junction-approach SPEED for EVERY minor-link turn, so it must stay
byte-identical on scenarios 08/11/26/32/33/38/39/40 while adding the cont-turn dips — a delicate
multi-part port needing `getFoeVisibilityDistance` (netconvert-derived) and internal-junction modelling.
Its own rung; the exact target trajectory + formula above make it a well-specified next task. Anchor
`scenarios/_diag/cont-turn-sequence` (sequence only today) + scenario 44 (skip-gated) are the gates.

## Git state at handoff
- `main` = `eac0a5b` (C4-vii-b + crash fix) — the shippable, testable state.
- Branch `claude/handoff-docs-i5a9vm` = all of main + C4-vii-a part 1 (`1cb6c12`) + the diagnosis
  commits. Decide per sub-bug whether to keep building on this branch or restart from `main`.
